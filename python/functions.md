1. Navigating Built-in Functions: Learning how to use the help() function to understand any Python function.
2. Creating Your Own Functions: Understanding the syntax of def, how to handle arguments, and the role of the return statement.
3. Documentation with Docstrings: Using triple-quoted strings to explain your code to others.
4. Flexible Functions: Implementing default arguments to make parameters optional.
5. Higher-Order Functions: Learning how to pass functions as arguments to other functions for more powerful code.


Quick Overview of the Fundamentals
• The Power of help(): This is arguably the most important function. It allows you to see a function's header and a description of what it does. For example, help(round) explains that it takes a number and an optional ndigits argument.

• Defining and Returning: You define a function using the def keyword. The return keyword is vital because it exits the function and passes a value back to the caller. Without a return statement, a function will return None by default.

• Docstrings: These are descriptions placed immediately after the function header using triple quotes. They are displayed when someone calls help() on your custom function, making your code much more professional and accessible.

• Default Arguments: You can assign default values to arguments (e.g., def greet(who="World"):). This allows the function to be called with or without that specific argument.

Does this sound like a good starting point? We can start with built-in functions and the help() system, or jump straight into defining your own functions if you prefer. What would you like to do first?
