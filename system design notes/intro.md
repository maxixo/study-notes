we define software architecture as a high-level description of a system’s structure, its components, and how they communicate to meet specific requirements and constraints 2, 3. To help you understand the core concepts, here is a quick breakdown of what we will cover:
The Power of Structure: Just as a theater is designed for shows and a house for living, software architecture determines if a product can scale, perform, and remain secure 4, 5.
Abstraction over Implementation: Architecture is about the "big picture." It focuses on how "black box" components interact while hiding implementation details like specific programming languages or frameworks 6, 7.
The Design Phase: Architecture is the primary output of the design phase and serves as the essential input for implementation 8, 9.
Large-Scale Focus: We will specifically look at high-level abstractions where components are separate services running across different computers to handle millions of users 10, 11.
Getting this right is critical because restructuring a poorly designed system is incredibly expensive and time-consuming
